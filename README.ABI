When using gnu-efi 4.0 with an application which was written
for gnu-efi 3.0, it may be required to set the GNU_EFI_3_0_COMPAT compile flag
this changes the default versions of some changed functions back to their prior
versions

This currently includes the following functions:
    * ReallocatePool
    * CopyMem
    * CompareGuid
